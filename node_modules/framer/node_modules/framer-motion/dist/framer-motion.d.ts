/**
 * The `AnimatePresence` component enables the use of the `exit` prop to animate components
 * when they're removed from the component tree.
 *
 * When adding/removing more than a single child component, every component
 * **must** be given a unique `key` prop.
 *
 * You can propagate exit animations throughout a tree by using variants.
 *
 * @library
 *
 * You can use any component(s) within `AnimatePresence`, but the first `Frame` in each should
 * have an `exit` property defined.
 *
 * ```jsx
 * import { Frame, AnimatePresence } from 'framer'
 *
 * // As items are added and removed from `items`
 * export function Items({ items }) {
 *   return (
 *     <AnimatePresence>
 *       {items.map(item => (
 *         <Frame
 *           key={item.id}
 *           initial={{ opacity: 0 }}
 *           animate={{ opacity: 1 }}
 *           exit={{ opacity: 0 }}
 *         />
 *       ))}
 *     </AnimatePresence>
 *   )
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * @motion
 *
 * You can use any component(s) within `AnimatePresence`, but the first `motion` component in each should
 * have an `exit` property defined.
 *
 * ```jsx
 * import { motion, AnimatePresence } from 'framer-motion'
 *
 * export const Items = ({ items }) => (
 *   <AnimatePresence>
 *     {items.map(item => (
 *       <motion.div
